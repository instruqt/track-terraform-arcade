      Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

      It can manage existing and popular (cloud) service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform has a declarative model to describe what resources should be created.

      These resources are defined in one or more configuration files, effectively enabling [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html#infrastructure-as-code).
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Before Terraform can manage infrastructure, the workspace needs to be initialized.

      The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.

      This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control.

  title: Planning ahead
  teaser: Planning ahead
  assignment: Create a plan based on the terraform configuration files in your home
    folder, and have terraform write the plan to *plan.out* in your home directory.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Based on the desired state specified in the configuration files, and the current state of your infrastructure, Terraform can determine the necessary actions to achieve that state.

      The terraform [plan command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) is used to show these actions and record them in an execution plan. No changes will be made to your infrastructure yet.

  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The terraform [apply command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state.

      It can either directly apply the configuration files, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.

      The most important thing you'll configure with Terraform are [resources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html).

      Every resource in the terraform configuration represents a component of your infrastructure.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      A resource configuration block looks like the following:

      ```
      resource "consul_node" "arcade" {
        address = "192.168.10.10"
        name    = "arcade"
      }
      ```
  - type: text
    contents: Every resource configuration block specifies the *type* of the resource
      (e.g. "consul_node"), its *name* in terraform (e.g. "arcade"), and a list of
      properties specific to that resources (e.g. "address" and "name").

  title: Switching workspaces
  teaser: Create a workspaces with its own state
  assignment: |-
    We are currently working in the default workspace, but are ready to go to prod.

    Create a prod workspace and switch to it.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      When terraform creates infrastructure, it stores the properties of those components in its state.

      The state is saved in a [workspace](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/workspace/index.html). By default, terraform will store its state in a workspace called *default*.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform allows you to create multiple workspaces.

      This enables you to create different and independent states, based on the same configuration.

      For instance for a staging and production environment, or for your feature branches.

  title: Importing resources
  teaser: Import existing resources
  assignment: |-
    There is an additional database named *backup* in the PostgreSQL instance.
    Import it into the state as *backup*.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform is able to [import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) existing infrastructure.

      This allows you take resources you've created by some other means and bring it under Terraform management.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Importing is done using the [import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/import.html) command.

      To import a resource, specify its terraform address (typically a resource type and name) and the ID for that specific resource.

      Note that importing a resources only imports it into the state. It will not generate the corresponding configuration files.

  title: Tainting resources
  teaser: Mark existing resources for destruction
  assignment: We need a new certificate, mark the resource as tained, so it will be
    marked for recreation.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The terraform [taint](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html) command manually marks a Terraform-managed resource as tainted, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply.

      It will not modify infrastructure directly, but will only modify the terraform state file.

  assignment: |-
    Rename the resource named *certificate* to *self-signed*.

    Then make sure this *move* is reflected in the state.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The terraform [state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/index.html) command is used for advanced state management.

      It can move, rename or remove resources from a state file. And it can be used to list all resources, or show details of a specific resource.

  assignment: |-
    The code changes don't validate and can't be applied.

    Find the problems and fix them so they pass validation.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The terraform [validate](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/validate.html) command is used to validate the syntax of the terraform files.

      It will check for many syntax problems, like invalid HCL syntax or references, duplicate configurations and invalid interpolations.
